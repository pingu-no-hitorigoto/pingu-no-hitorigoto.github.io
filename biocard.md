### BioCard Gallery

#### Ver 1, 2019/10/01

Made in Oct. 1, 2019, right after Ingress REDACTED retired.

The draft of front side didn't spend me too long. Although there are newer design available, I choose the 2016 ver as my starting point due to its simplicity. Due to lacking of experience working with PhotoShop, it still a challenge to both me and my poor laptop to make it real.

The back side, however, spent me several days to write something in NIA style. It should be descriptive, should just fit into the layout, should not too serious. I have to say, I hate writing.

By the way, this page was created after I had everything printed. I almost forgot there is a QR code pointing to here, ha ha.
